Python projects to get started with my journey in coding.
A simple snake game with the ascii graphic directly in the terminal. 

Python provides a very simple way of create animation on the terminal.
It exist the os.system("clear") that simply clear the terminal.


The implementation don't use Objects even if the would have been very usefull
because this small procjet born as a simple little homework for a friend of mine
that is learning how to program and don't know yet how to use Objects.
